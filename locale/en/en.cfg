[technology-description]
better-turrets=More powerful and durable turret defenses.
plasma-turrets=A faster-shooting and more damaging version of laser turrets.
cannon-turrets=Slow-firing, long-range and high-calibre turrets that prioritize spitter targets.
shockwave-turrets=Short-range turrets that will attack all enemies in range at once; well-suited to large waves of weak enemies, or as as a last line of defence.
last-stand-turrets=Power failed and the base is undefended? These turrets will prove quite lethal if destroyed, as a last-ditch effort to protect other structures.

big-radar=A radar that only scans known area but keeps the entire area visible and frequently updated.

spiked-walls=Walls that hurt attackers.
tough-walls=Stronger walls.
tough-spiked-walls=Stronger walls that hurt attackers.

logistic-defence=Allowing logistic robots to defend themselves.
electric-defence=Modifying power poles so that they can shock and kill attackers.

plasma-turret-speed=Faster plasma firing.
plasma-turret-damage=More damaging plasma projectiles.
concussion-turret-damage=More powerful firing canisters for the concussion turrets.

hi-ex-shells=Tank shells with a large range and which deal heavy area damage.
nuclear-shells=Devastating weaponry, capable of obliterating a large area.
napalm-shells=For cleansing large areas of the map with a sea of fire.
napalm-rockets=For cleansing large areas of the map with a sea of fire.
fire-ammo=Ammunition that burns the enemy as well as normal physical damage.

better-tank=A more durable tank with a better engine and more firepower.

power-armor-3=Power Armor with more upgradeability and more defensive power.
advanced-equipment=Better power armor upgrades.

capsules=Better AOE damage capsules.

flamethrower-2=A better flame thrower with longer range, burn time, and greater damage.

healing-alloys=Harnessing biters' healing abilities for your own defences. Healing: __2__% (limit __3__), __1__% chance per second

turret-range=Increasing the range of your turrets. Range Boost: +__1__ [+__2__ Total]

orbital-destroyer=Destroy the enemy automatically and across the map, with range, ease, and power second to nothing else.

radiation=Radiation


[item-description]
biter-flesh=Harvested from dead biters and spawners to learn their biology.
biter-flesh-rotting=Harvested from the aliens to learn their biology. Will rot if not put into storage.
last-stand-turret=Does not shoot on its own, but if destroyed will kill any enemy in a large area, at the cost of heavy damage to - but not destruction of - nearby structures.

space-plasma=Plasma turrets require space science
space-nukes=Nuclear shells require space science
deconstruct-flesh=Mark alien drops for deconstruction
deconstruct-flesh-timer=Alien drop deconstruction delay
radiation-timer=Radiation lifetime
crated-ammo-boost=Crated ammo damage boost
rotting-flesh=Allow alien tissue to rot if not stored
flesh-unit-drops=Biter/Spitter units drop tissue


[mod-setting-description]
space-plasma=This gates the high-end plasma turrets behind the space science and by extension the rocket silo.
space-nukes=This gates the high-end nuclear shells behind the space science and by extension the rocket silo.
deconstruct-flesh=Automatically marks drops from alien death for robot deconstruction after a configurable delay.
deconstruct-flesh-timer=The length of time (in seconds) between an alien dropping an item and the item being marked for deconstruction. Shorter times clear items faster but increase the risk of robots flying into regions still packed with enemies.
radiation-timer=The length of time (in seconds) that radiation from a neutron bomb lasts.
crated-ammo-boost=The per-bullet damage boost (in %) of crated ammo over its consituent. Clamped to within [5,100]%.
rotting-flesh=If enabled, alien tissue kept in player or vehicle inventories gradually degrades, encouraging logistics to carry it to storage (where it lasts forever).
flesh-unit-drops=If false, Alien Tissue will only be dropped from spawners and worms. Be warned that this makes it effectively alien artifacts, which were removed from the base game due to the fact that they cannot be automated and must be manually acquired.
